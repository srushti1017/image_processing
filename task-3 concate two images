# After swapping we will see task-4.3 how to concatinate two images let's see !!! 
For concatinating two images there are two ways 1st concatinate vertically and concatinate horizontally and for both operations there is a straight forward syntax is given in opencv library... These is for the same size images. for vertically use keyword vconcat([img1_var , img1_var]) for horizontally use keyword hconcat([img1_var , img1_var])

    #concatinate two images vertically
    ver = cv2.vconcat([imge2, imge2])

    #show combined image
    cv2.imshow('combine1', ver)
    cv2.waitKey()
    cv2.DestroyAllWindows()
    
     In this way we can create images , swapp the images also we can concatinate images.ðŸ’¯âœŒ

# Firstly we will see how to create our own image in open cv using python code . For that we need jupyter in our system after installing jupyter we have to install OpenCv library. Here we also use some modules for image processing like numpy for implementing arrays and matplotlib for the visual understanding by drawing graphs.

          pip install Opencv-python
          pip install numpy 
          pip install matplotlib

Now see our 1st task that is to create image . For that we have to import cv2 library , numpy library and matplotlib library

        import cv2
        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Here we will create 2 images for that use following syntax :

        imge1 = cv2.imread('dog1.png')   
        imge2 = cv2.imread('dog2.png')

Above we created two images now we will show these 2 images syntax for the same is as follow :

        #show 1st image 
        plt.title('original')
        plt.imshow(imge1)

        #show 2nd image
        plt.title('original1')
        plt.imshow(imge2)
        
 Here we are done with task 1...

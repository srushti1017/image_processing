Hello guys now we will move towards task-4.2 i.e. to create two images and then swap them , for that we will use for loop...

        temp = np.zeros([600 , 800 , 3])
        for i in range (50 , 150 ):
            for j in range (50 , 170):
                 temp[i , j ] = imge1[i , j]
                 imge1[i , j] = imge2[i , j]
                 imge2[i , j] = temp[i , j]

Now to show the images after swapping :

         #1st image after swapping
         plt.title('original')
         plt.imshow(imge1)

         #2nd image after swapping
         plt.title('original')
         plt.imshow(imge2)
         
Here our task-4.2 is completed !!!
